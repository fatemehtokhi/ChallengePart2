# ChallengePart2
- ValidPhoneNumber:Write a function that accepts a string, and returns true if it is in the form of a phone number.Assume that any integer from 0-9 in any of the spots will produce a valid phone number.
- SumOfDigit:A digital root is the recursive sum of all the digits in a number. Given n, take the sum of the digits of n. If that value has more than one digit, continue reducing in this way until a single-digit number is produced. This is only applicable to the natural numbers.
- PrimeNumber:Which Numbers is primeNumber? 
- ValueAscciNumber:How we show ascci number of a character.
- Convert char to String und viceversa.
- Consecutivesum:
- SplitString:Complete the solution so that it splits the string into pairs of two characters. If the string contains an odd number of characters then it should replace the missing second character of the final pair with an underscore ('_').
- Concatenate two Arrays with using method arraycopy
- Join two list with using Addall() and Stream.
- ConvertListToArray,with using Method toArray().
- ConvertArrayToList,with using Method asList().
- Finding Middle of Character in String.(Without For Loop).
- Finding Maximum and Minimum value in List.
- BitCounting: returns the number of bits that are equal to one in the binary representation of that number.
- ConvertMapToList:Since map contains a key, value pair, we need two lists to store each of them, namely keyList for keys and valueList for values.
- CreateDirectory: create directory with using method mkdir().
